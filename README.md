## Hi there! 👋

I'm Marian, a passionate developer based in Amsterdam, NL. I love crafting innovative solutions and exploring the latest technologies in the software development world. Let's connect!

Feel free to clone or contribute to any of the repositories if you find them useful. But be warned, the quality and maturity of the code ranges from "works for me" to "other people use it, too". Some code may not even work at all.
